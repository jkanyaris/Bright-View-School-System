Welcome to the Department of Boarding at Tech High school. We are always service centred to ensure that
our students are comfortable during their school session.
The department is manned by four hard working and dedicated teachers and a matron. 
This department provides a home away from home for our students. 
Dormitories are situated within a secure compound in the heart of the school compound.
 The quality of boarding facilities are excellent and contributes much to students' 
 education and personal development. It contributes to our goals of offering quality
 education to all students from different parts of the country as well as all distant areas.
 We carry out hygiene measures at the dormitories 
to achieve an environment which the students can have the pride to call it their second home.
At least a student will spent most of time at school thus the need for maximum comfort.
We allocate bed space  to students and ensure that the students are settled so as to provide ample environment for 
them to pursue their education.
 We work hand in hand with dorm captains who assist us in identifying areas we need to address. Clean water is also available at 
 various wash rooms and designated areas for laundry during students' free time.
<br/>
 We are looking forward to serve you.
<br/>
