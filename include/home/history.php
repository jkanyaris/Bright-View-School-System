<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Janiuay church, another Augustinian built church, was started by Friar Miquel Carod who was assigned to Janiuay as the parish priest between 1830 and 1871.</li>
<br />
<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual construction was started in 1849 but Friar Carod died in November 1871 with the &apos;finishing touches&apos; yet to be made to the church. His replacement, Friar Nicholas Gallo completed the church and subsequently built the adjoining &apos;convento&apos; in the same style as the church itself.</li>
<br />
<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one more example of a church being built with forced labour. The stone used in construction was quarried in nearby Dingle and various other materials were transported by balsa wood rafts from Guimaras Island some 35 to 45 kilometers to the south. Friar Carod had kilns built near the construction site, to fire the bricks that were fabricated on-site.</li>
<br />
<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church which measured approximately 250 feet long by 50 feet wide, was considered to be another &apos;fortress&apos; church and was considered to be on of the largest churches in the region. Some hints of its being a fortress church can be observed in the ruins of the old church.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a recent visit to Janiuay, when exploring the ruins one more time, we happened upon Ian  Celebrar, a young Janiuay artist, who was at work painting the reproduction of a picture of the original church on one the walls in the main stairway up to the new &apos;Contemplation Garden&apos;  on the upper floor of the ruins of the old church. A second painting he had just completed was of the Janiuay Cemetery. Both are pictured here for your appreciation. We are in the process of trying to obtain a print of the original pictures for use on this site.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church flourished until the Japanese Occupation which started in 1942. The church was put to the torch in early 1942.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unclear whether it was torched by the Filipino Resistance to prevent its use by the Japanese or by the Japanese themselves to extinguish any resistance from the citizens against their regime of occupation, which was very brutal indeed.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the church and adjoining convento were destroyed and were not restored over the years since the war.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact it took over 23 years after liberation before the parish opened its new church; the one we can visit today which was built immediately adjacent to the ruins of the original.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Janiuay church was dedicated in 1968.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent several hours on site and recorded the ruins as they stand today, to try to rediscover the majesty that once was theChurchofSaint Julian.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins as we viewed them appeared to have been as high as a two story structure. It was constructed as mentioned earlier of limestone from Dingle, stones and rocks brought in from Guimaras as well as bricks made and fired at the site itself.</li><br />

<li class="readme">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On approaching the site of the new church we walk past the ruins and one of the first things we see is this wall of red brick and limestone.</li><br />
