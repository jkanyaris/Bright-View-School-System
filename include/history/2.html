This is one more example of a church being built with forced<br/>
labour. The stone used in construction was quarried in nearby<br/>
Dingle and various other materials were transported by balsa<br/>
wood rafts from Guimaras Island some 35 to 45 kilometers<br/>
to the south. Friar Carod had kilns built near the  construction<br/>
site, to fire the bricks that were fabricated on-site.<br/>

The church flourished until the Japanese Occupation which started <br/>
in 1942. The church was put to the torch in early 1942.<br/>
In any event, the church and adjoining convento were destroyed<br/>
and were not restored over the years since the war.<br/>
