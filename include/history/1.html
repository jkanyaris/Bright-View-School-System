<center>The original Janiuay church, another Augustinian built church,<br/>
was started by Friar Miquel Carod who was assigned to<br/>
Janiuay as the parish priest between 1830 and 1871.</center>
<br />

<center>The actual construction was started in 1849 but Friar Carod<br/>
died in November 1871 with the &apos;finishing touches&apos; yet to be<br/>
made to the church. His replacement, Friar Nicholas Gallo<br/>
completed the church and subsequently built the adjoining<br/>
&apos;convento&apos; in the same style as the church itself.</center>
