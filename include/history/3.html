In fact it took over 23 years after liberation before the parish<br/>
opened its new church; the one we can visit today which was<br/>
built immediately adjacent to the ruins of the original.<br/>

The new Janiuay church was dedicated in 1968.<br/>

The ruins as we viewed them appeared to have been as high as a<br/>
two story structure. It was constructed as mentioned earlier of<br/>
limestone from Dingle, stones and rocks brought in from Guimaras<br/>
as well as bricks made and fired at the site itself.<br/>

On approaching the site of the new church we walk past the<br/>
ruins and one of the first things we see is this wall of<br/>
red brick and limestone.<br/>
