Welcome to the Department of Humanities. 
The humanities department consists of Geography, Christian Religious Education (C.R.E) and History.
It is known as the " booster department" because students score high grades in these subjects and this boosts their own mean grades and also the school's mean grade. This makes the subjects very popular, with each boasting of over 100 learners.
This is the department that prepares future lawyers, diplomats, judges, political scientists and social scientists like psychologists, counselors and teachers. Evidently, these are careers that deal closely with human beings. Thus the department can be said to teach the learners to be "more human".

We offer students the opportunity to pursue 
a broadly based program of study emphasizing the different ways in which human cultures
 and their multiple forms of expression have developed historically and continue to develop today.
Humanities courses devote particular attention to the ways peoples in various times 
and places have expressed cultural values, practices and ideas of a philosophical, 
religious, moral, political and aesthetic nature. They foster a critical approach to
 reading and research that, in helping students learn to identify and question 
 preconceived assumptions and values, allows them to engage and appreciate the 
 interrelationship between diverse value systems and thereby to develop an 
 analysis of the human and of human community. The humanity department is made up of the following staff:
<br/>
<ul><li>Mr Tum </li>
<li>Mrs Mwende </li>
<li>Mr Collins </li>
<li>Mrs Injera </li>

</ul>
