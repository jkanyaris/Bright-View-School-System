This is an integral part in this institution. This department is meant to assist the students 
in all aspects of life. It is aimed at improving student performance as well as developing 
personalities that will enable them live an achievable life in future.
Guidance and counseling has programs for the students group and individual counseling. 
To enable effective results, there is a group of peer counselors who are trained to help other students. These are assisted by teacher counselors.
The counseling has borne good results especially in the academics. 
Through the academic counseling, the students are assisted to realize themselves to 
attain good grades. Academic counseling helps the students to gain confidence and develop the attitude of hard work.

The teaching and non-teaching members are also catered by the counseling department. 
Speakers are invited to speak to them and this has developed self-fulfillment at individual and group level.
 The department 
 is student centered where it promotes and facilitates character formation 
 in students through role modelling. The department invites professional counselors
 to speak on given topics e.g. sexuality, spiritual matters, academic performance, honesty etc.
 Various forums are also organized to advice and guide the students on how to relate with each 
 other and how to interact with their teachers and parents. One to one guidance and counseling
 is also greatly encouraged which is done by all the members of the department Who include 
 the Senior H.O.D,and teacher counselorâ€™s namely  Mr. Tum, Mrs.Gichuki, Mr. Chebet and Mrs.C.Mwangi
counselors.
